## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This project implements a DC Exciter Business Logic Execution application. Users can input field current and terminal voltage values, and the application executes business logic to determine system stability, frequency, corrections, and power generated.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
The application is built using Spring Boot and utilizes a RESTful API to execute business logic based on user-provided input. The project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns by modularizing the application into different components, including entities, service, and controllers.

## Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>
- Java
- Spring Boot
- RESTful API
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Axios

## Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>
The project is structured as follows:
- **Entities**: Contains classes representing the application's business logic and related data.
- **Controller**: Includes controllers that handle HTTP requests and integrate with the business logic.
- **Service**: Houses the service layer, which interacts with the business logic and entities.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
To get started with the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
3. Run the application.
4. Access the application in a web browser.

## How to Execute the Business Logic <a name="how-to-execute-the-business-logic"></a>
The business logic can be executed by providing field current and terminal voltage values. Follow these steps:
1. Click the "Execute Business Logic" button.
2. Enter the field current and terminal voltage in the pop-up prompts.
3. View the business logic execution results in a pop-up dialog.

## Integration with the Web Application <a name="integration-with-the-web-application"></a>
The application is integrated with the web interface using JavaScript and Axios. The user is prompted to input values directly via pop-up dialogs, allowing seamless execution of business logic.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The DC Exciter Business Logic Execution application demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot with a web interface to execute complex business logic. The usage of modern technologies ensures a user-friendly experience and efficient handling of input parameters.
